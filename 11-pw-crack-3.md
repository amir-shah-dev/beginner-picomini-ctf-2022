## Objectives

> - To be able to understand and exploit application code
> - To be able to conceptualise brute force attacks

1. Open "level3.py" in your terminal
2. Notice the list of potential passwords on line 44? You can try something called a brute force attack where you essentially go through the list of passwords and try them out until you stumble upon the correct one

It may not seem particularly clever but it is very useful way of gaining the correct password/keys. Reason being that computers have advanced to the point where they can 'crack' a password in mere moments.

How do you counter this?
First off never hardcode secrets into your application code.
Secondly, always use a strong password to stave off these brute force attacks.
