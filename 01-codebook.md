## Objectives

> - To be able to download and execute a python script

1. Start by downloading the required files using the Webshell
  
  ```console
  wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/102/code.py
  
  wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/102/codebook.txt
  ```
2. You can use the command `ls` to check that the relevant files have been downloaded locally. Make sure that both `code.py` and `codebook.txt` are in the same directory

  You can do this by entering the following command 
  ```console
  python3 code.py
  ```
