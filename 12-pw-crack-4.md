1. Open `level4.py` in your terminal. Do you notice anything _different_? We are now dealing with more passwords that we can manually handle. I don't know about you but I don't want to sit here and type out every single password. Why not let the computer do it for us?
2. Try to edit the the program `level4.py` in your favourite terminal editor. Your aim is to figure out a way to go through the list of possible passwords.
