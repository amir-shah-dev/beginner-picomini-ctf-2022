# PW Crack 5

This time our list of passwords have gotten much longer and are now placed in a completely separate file called `dictionary.txt`. How will we brute force it this time around?

## Objectives

> - To be able to conceptualise brute force attacks
> - To be able to create short scripts to carry out brute force attacks

1. Edit `level5.py` file to open the `dictionary.txt`
2. Use a **for loop** to iterate through the potential passwords in the dictionary

Try using pythons inbuilt function called `open()` to read the file. Its default behaviour is to read through the file line by line which is convenient for us since this is how the passwords are separated in `dictionary.txt`.

>Still stuck? Remember that there are invisible characters you have to be wary of. These are whitespace characters like ` \t\r\n` which affects the hashing of the string. You need to trim these before hashing.
